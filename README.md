Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion on specific brands or topics. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we categorized sentiments to provide insights into public sentiment trends.

Project Overview

Objective: To analyze and visualize sentiment trends in social media data, categorizing public opinion as positive, negative, or neutral.

Tools: Python, TextBlob, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.


Dataset

The dataset includes social media posts with fields related to:

Text Content: The main text of each post.

Date: The date the post was created.

Other Metadata: Additional data such as post ID or user information, where applicable.


> Note: The dataset required preprocessing to handle missing values and clarify column names for better readability in visualizations.



Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values to ensure dataset quality.

Renamed columns for improved clarity and readability.



2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted initial data exploration to identify patterns and understand the distribution of sentiments.



3. Sentiment Categorization:

Used TextBlob to classify each post's sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative.

Ensured consistency and accuracy in sentiment labeling.



4. Data Visualization:

Created visualizations to represent the distribution of sentiment across posts, with:

Sentiment Distribution: Showing overall sentiment breakdown.

Time-Series Analysis: Observing sentiment trends over time.

Word Clouds: Displaying frequently used words by sentiment category.





Key Learnings

Data Preprocessing is crucial for creating reliable and meaningful insights.

Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob provided an effective approach to categorizing text sentiment with simplicity and accuracy.

Visualization Techniques help convey sentiment trends and make insights accessible to a broader audience.
